# Raspberry Pi Pico W Client to Client Communication 
Uses two Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontrollers's on the same wireless network to send data packet from one pico to another pico. Example was made with a magnetic reed switch connected to one pico for reading door state and writing the state to a small 1.8" display on the other one.
